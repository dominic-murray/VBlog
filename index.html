                    The first website that you may wanna check out is : <a href="https://minimalistbaker.com/" target="_blank">Minimalist Baker</a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The minimalist baker has been supplying me new and creative websites for the past year. One interesting trick she taught me was creating the consistency of an egg using flax seed and a bit of water I have used this in multiple recipies from cakes to kofte.
