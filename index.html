                    The minimalist baker has been supplying me new and creative websites for the past year. One interesting trick she taught me was creating the consistency of an egg using flax seed and a bit of water I have used this in multiple recipies from cakes to kofte.

                    <p>Hi, I am Dominic. I have loved food for ever I know we as humans might struggle without food but I actually enjoy just about everything. I am more vegitarian than vegan but I love to cook and my wife is vegan so I pretty much just cook and prepare vegan dishes. I paint, draw, photograph, code, plant, build literally will try any task. I think that is enough about me lets look at some food.</p>
